the general concept is my background will be a daydream that I am having while in class 

the intro shot will be the same color as the background of zoom so it hopefully looks seamless

It will then slowly transition to a monochrome grid as I have been enjoying playing with 3d form on a two dimensional plane. I want to incorporate that some how.

I also think the idea of the grid falling into itself and slowly becoming more colorful would intensive the daydream aspect 

I don’t want to add too much but I have ideas of what my daydreams normally consist of and might want to add those if it looks right but I don’t think it will be needed as it might be cluttered in the small format of zoom

It would then end almost instantly and go back to the zoom background

I have also never used premier with stock footage which i am assuming I will have to use or I am going to have to make all this in a different program which might be intense
